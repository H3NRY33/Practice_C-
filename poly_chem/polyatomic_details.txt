A small polyatomic ion review program.
Takes an arbitrary polyatomic ion from a defined list. User will be given a compound OR a compound name.
Based off of that, the user will be asked to identify the correct charge, compound/compound name ... OR ALL.

Score Tracking : keeps track of correct answers ...( Will add 3 strikes you're out )
Current Streak : number of correct questions answered consecutively.
Mastery: highest streak by user ... returns a ratio of max streak/total polyatomic ions.

There set and get functions for each.
One of the first OOP small project for practice. Frankly, it's taking more longer than it should.
